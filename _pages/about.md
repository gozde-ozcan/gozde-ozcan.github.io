This is Gözde Özcan. I am a PhD student in [SPIRAL](https://web.northeastern.edu/spiral/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu) supervised by [Prof. Stratis Ioannidis](https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/ioannidis/index.html). My research is focused on submodular optimization and machine learning algorithms for set functions. Previously, I was a machine learning engineer intern at Meta, working with [Dr. Antonia Gogoglou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gogoglouantonia/) (2022) and [Dr. Chenyang Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chenyang-zhang-04007536/) (2021). I received my master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Northeastern University (2021) and my bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) in Ankara, Türkiye (2018). I am looking for Researcher positions based in Europe and the US starting from Fall 2024.
